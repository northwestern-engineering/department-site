### Feature Slideshow {#feature-slideshow}

The Feature Slideshow on the department homepage includes features you create and McCormick news articles (which marketing will add to your site). The slideshow can feature **up to six slides**. It has the same controls as the basic page slideshow. You can choose to randomize which slide appears first when the page loads, automatically advance the slides and modify the intervals between each rotation.

When adding a new slide choose &quot;Department Feature&quot; as Slide Source. Fill out all the appropriate fields for the slide including:

*   Link Type
*   Internal or External Link
*   Headline – Displays in bold, capitalized letter across the bottom half of the slide
*   Float Text – To select whether the text floats above the left or right side of the slide image. If the subject of your photo is on the one side, you should likely float the text on the opposite side.
*   Summary – Displays below the headline in normal text at the desktop size. It does not display at mobile sizes. 150 character maximum!
*   Link Text – This should be a short action for your readers such as &quot;learn more&quot;. The link text defaults to &quot;read more&quot; if no other text is entered.
*   Image – **This image must be cropped to 990 x 435 px!**
*   Alternate Text – This text describes what&#039;s inside the image for search engines and does not display.

You&#039;ll notice that some slides have been filled out for you and have a source of &quot;McCormick News&quot;. You have full control to edit these slides. Edit the Headline text in the appropriate field. If you&#039;d like to edit anything else about the slide, select “Yes” for &quot;Do you want to change the Summary, Image, etc?&quot; and the fields for those items will appear for you to edit.

#### Areas of Study WYSIWYG {#areas-of-study-wysiwyg}

You can include content related to your department programs below each areas of study table. To do this, select &quot;Yes&quot; for &quot;Include optional __ programs content (if applicable)&quot; in the corresponding main content region.

### Sidebar {#sidebar}

The sidebar area on the department homepage is made up of all the content in the right column under the slideshow. It includes recent news, optional content areas, events and social media.

#### News {#news}

The homepage news feed will **automatically** feature the **latest four news stories** created by your department or created by McCormick marketing and tagged for your department. This will keep fresh news content on your homepage without a need to manage it. However, if you&#039;d like to feature news in this area at the top of the list that is not being pulled in automatically, you have the option to create **up to two Top News** **items** from the homepage edit window.

Fill in the text to display in the Link Text field and the link details in the Link Type fields. Remember, only four total news items can display at once. So, any added here will remove one from the bottom of the feed.
