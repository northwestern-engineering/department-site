## News Index {#news-index}

The Department &quot;news/index&quot; page displays a reverse chronological list of the most recent marketing articles tagged for the department and the most recent original articles created by the department. News Articles can be searched by Keyword and Year. The sidebar regions of this page can be edited just as those of a basic page. No content should be entered in the main content areas of this page.

**Note**: It may take up to an hour for newly created articles to appear in this index.
