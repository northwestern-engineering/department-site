## News Article Sidebar {#news-article-sidebar}

Below is a sample news article on the Mechanical Engineering site. The right sidebar of every department news article displays the **four of the most recent news stories** from a pool of McCormick marketing articles tagged for the specific department and original articles from the department. Links to the stories appear in reverse chronological order.

The &quot;Join Us&quot; section in the sidebar display&#039;s the department&#039;s social media and is controlled from the department&#039;s homepage. Below that is a region to link to a news related item such as a newsletter signup. The Header, Copy, Link Text, and Link can all be customized. This bottom area is the only region in the sidebar you have control to edit.
